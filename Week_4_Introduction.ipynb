    "# Introduction\n",
    "New York's demographics show that it is a one of the populous cities in United States. New York has the largest metropolean area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metrolpolian statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The consumer market contributes significantly to New York's economy. New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Since the New York metropolitan area continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for Russian immigrants, Russian cousine had become very popular in New York.\n",

    "This final project explores the best locations for Russian restaurants throughout the New York area. During recent years many new caf√©s and restaurants have opened in New York area, providing the usual mix of Russiann food; but unfortunately the level of Russian cuisine is not that high. Since the amount of Russian restaurants is at the low level and the revenue from catering enteprices has been growing in the recent years, opening a new Russian restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. The location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. The project will attempt to answer that question."
